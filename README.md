> `Function:` block of reusable code that performs a specific task when called.
> <br>
> `**kwargs:` an abbreviation for keyword arguments, they are used when you want to allow a function to accept any number of named arguments that have not been explicitly defined beforehand.

In Python, ___functions___ are first-class _objects_, that is, they can be passed as arguments and assigned to variables.
> `def` creates an instance of the `function` class

<h2>Built-in Functions</h2>

These are functions that are integrated directly into the language and are always available for use, without the need to import additional modules.

* `help():` Provides documentation and help information about Python.

<details>

<summary>how to use help</summary>

* Get help on a specific object: 

```
help(object)
```

* Get help on a built-in function:

```
help(print)
```

</details>

* `print():` Print values ‚Äã‚Äãto the console.

> print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
> <br>
>`args:` values that will be printed;
> <br>
> `sep:` separator between values;
> <br>
> `end:` what happens at the end ('/n' is a line break);
> <br>
> `file:` here you can put the file name and its extension (.txt, for example);
> <br>
> `flush:` controls whether the buffer should be flushed after calling the function;

```
var = Brazil
print(var, ' is a country', sep=':', end='.' )
```

* `type():` Returns the type of the object declared inside the parentheses.

```
type(var)
# output: 'str'
```

<h3>Python Typing</h3>

In Python, it is not necessary to declare the variable's type explicitly ('str', int(1), float(1.2), bool(true or false)...), as it is automatically determined based on the value assigned to it.

‚Üí This makes the language `flexible` and `dynamic`.

<details>

<summary>Curiosity</summary>

> It is possible to make type annotation to facilitate reading:
> <br>
> name: str = "Alice"

</details>

üìÉ Python uses the `snake_case` pattern by convention!

* `input():` function that captures a value entered by the user in the console.

```
var = input("Type your name: ")
```

üö® Attention: this function always returns str type!

<h3>Conversion Functions</h3>

* `int():` converts to an integer value;
* `float():` converts to an float value;
* `str():` converts to a string value (text);
* `chr(int i):` returns the returns the `ASCII` character of an integer;
* `ord(char a):` returns the integer value of a character from the ASCII table;
* `bool():` converts to an boolean value (empty values ‚Äã‚Äãand 0 when applied return False);
* `list(), tuple(), set(), dict():` used to create lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries, respectively;

 <details>

<summary>ASCII</summary>

The `ASCII Table` (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a set of characters encoded to represent text.

> The printable values ‚Äã‚Äãstart from index __32__ and go up to __126__.

</details> 

<details>

<summary>decimal</summary>

* for more precision of floating point numbers:

```
from decimal import Decimal

num1 = Decimal('3.1415')
num2 = Decimal('2.7182')
multiplication = num1 * num2
```

‚Üí `Decimal():` class method.

‚Üí `decimal:` library.
</details>

‚Üí `round():` is used to round float values ‚Äã‚Äãto the nearest integer.

```
round(5.678) # 6
round(5.678,1) #is rounding the number to one decimal place, 5.7
```

‚Üí `abs():` for absolute (positive) values.

```
print(abs(-3.14)) # Output: 3.14
```

‚Üí `/` returns float and `//` returns int

> print(1/2 + ' and ' + 1//2) # 0.5 and 0

‚ûï is used to add and concatenate;
> print(1 + 2) returns: 3 // print('1' + 2) returns: 12

‚ùå Python does not perform implicit conversion, and a `sugar syntax` may occur in cases of `*` for example;

> print('1' * 2) returns: 1 \n 1

<h3>Conditional</h3>

* To create a conditional, use `if`, and comparison signs, such as `==, >, <, <=, >=, !=`;

* To add more conditions contrary to the first, use `elif` for more conditionals and for a condition if no other is satisfied, use `else`;

* Use `and` if two comparisons need to be true and `or` if only one condition needs to be true;

> if (condition1 and condition2):
> <br>
>----#execute code if true
> <br>
> elif (condition or other_condition):
> <br>
>----#execute code if "else if" is true
> <br>
> else: 
> <br>
>----#execute code if false         

üìë Indentation is mandatory in Python to create blocks of code!

> `ternary:` var = 'value' if condition else 'other_value'

‚ùóTo negate a Boolean value:

> `not` bool-condition

<h4>Truth Evaluation in Python</h4>

‚Üí In the context of Python, __true__ and __false__ are not limited to just the Boolean values ‚Äã‚Äã`True` and `False`; other values ‚Äã‚Äãare ___implicitly converted to True or False___ based on certain rules:

* Values ‚Äã‚Äãconsidered __false__: `None`, `False`, `0`, `0.0`, `0j` (complex zero), `''` (empty string), `[]` (empty list), `()` (empty tuple), `{}` (empty dictionary), `set()` (empty set), custom _class objects_ that implement the `__bool__()` or `__len__()` method and return `False` or `0`.
* Values ‚Äã‚Äãconsidered __true__: Any value ___that is not implicitly false___, such as `non-zero numbers`, `non-empty strings`, `non-empty lists`, etc.

<h3>Repeat loops</h3>

* `while:` it receives a condition to execute the block of code as long as the condition is true.

> while (condition):
> <br>
>----#execute the code as long as it is true
> <br>
> increment += value

* `+=` is used to update the value of the variable by adding a certain value to it.

* `for:` the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfor is to define the initial value and the final value, which the loop automatically increments.

‚Üí To define the initial and final value, use the `range()` function, passing them as a parameter.

> The `range()` function in Python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.

```
for i in range(5):
    print(i) # This will print the numbers 0 to 4.
    break # get out of the loop
    continue # to skip the rest of the code in the loop body and go to the next iteration.

for i in range(2, 8):
    print(i) # This will print the numbers 2 through 7.

for i in range(1, 10, 2): # range(start, stop, step), where step is the interval between the numbers
    print(i)
```

 <h3>Python Key words</h3>

> There are reserved value words (start with `UPPERCASE`):
> `True-False-None`
<br>

> And modifying reserved words (usually in `lowercase`):
> `if-while-in-not`

<h2>Built-in Modules</h2>

These are libraries that come with the Python installation.

<h3>random</h3>

> import __random__

‚Üí Offers a variety of methods for generating pseudorandom numbers and performing random selections.

```
random.random() * 100 # To increase the value 100 times
```

```
random.randrange(1,100) # creates a value from 1 to 100
```

```
random.randint(a, b) # returns a random integer between the values ‚Äã‚Äãa and b (inclusive).
```

* Random numbers are pseudo-random, as the value generated is actually a new `seed`. Therefore, it uses the milliseconds as a seed behind the scenes with the `seed()` function.

```
random.sample(seq, k) # : returns a list with k random elements of a sequence, without repetitions.
```

```
random.choice(seq) # randomly selects an element from a sequence.
```

```
random.shuffle(seq) # shuffles the elements of a sequence.
```

<h3>math</h3>

‚Üí Provides mathematical functions such as sine, cosine, logarithms, etc.

```
import math
print(math.sin(x)) # calculate the sine of x
math.sqrt(x) # Return the square root of x.
math.cos(x) # Return the cosine of x radians.
math.tan(x) # Return the tangent of x radians.
math.log10(x) # Return the base-10 logarithm of x.
math.pow(x, y) # Return x raised to the power y.
```

<h3>datetime</h3>

‚Üí Manipulation of dates and times.

```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
now = datetime.now() # Gets the current date

# Add a day to the current date
one_day = timedelta(days=1) # Define a timedelta object representing an interval of one day
tomorrow_date = now + one_day # Calculate tomorrow's date by adding one day interval to the current date

# Subtract a week from the current date
one_week = timedelta(weeks=1)
past_date = now - one_week

# Calculate the difference between two dates
other_date = datetime(2023, 12, 31)
difference = other_date - now

# String for Date or Time
date_string = "2023-05-20"
date = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
print(date)  # Output: 2023-05-20 00:00:00

# Formatting the date to "dd/MM/yyyy" format
date = datetime(2023, 5, 20)
formatted_date = data.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")
print(formatted_date) # Output: 05/20/2023
```

<h3>re (regex)</h3>

> import __re__

‚Üí Provides functions and classes for working with regular expressions (`regex`).

* `String raw (r):` means that the characters will be treated literally, without interpretation of escape characters, such as '\n'.

```
regex = r'C:\PathFolder\File'
```

<h4>Impersonation shortcuts</h4>

‚Üí `\` is used in `regex` to indicate special characters or ___metacharacters___ (also to disregard shortcuts, such as '\.').
* `\d:` any decimal digit;
* `\w:` any alphanumeric character;
* `\s:` any whitespace character;
*  `.:` any character except line break;

<h4>Search ranges</h4>

‚Üí __Comprehension__ with `[]`, __negation__ with `^`.

* `Numeric(\d):` use the format [0-9];
* `Letters:` [a-z], [A-Z];
* `Alphanumerics(\w):` [a-zA-Z0-9];
* `ASCII Printables:` [!-~];

<h4>Border shortcuts</h4>

* `^:` represents the beginning of a line or string;
* `$:` end of a line or string;
* `\A:` start of string, but not affected by multiple lines;
* `\Z:` end of string, case similar to `\A`;
* `\b:` word boundary, indicating a transition between an alphanumeric character and a non-alphanumeric character;
* `\B:` a position that is not the word boundary, regardless of whether it is at the beginning or end of a word;

<h4>Quantifier shortcuts</h4>

* `*:` matches zero or more occurrences of the previous pattern. 
* `+:` matches one or more occurrences of the previous pattern. 
* `?:` matches zero or one occurrence of the previous pattern. 
* `{n}:` correspond to exactly n occurrences of the previous pattern. 
* `{n,}:` matches n or more occurrences of the previous pattern. 
* `{n,m}:` with a minimum and maximum number {n,m} correspond to n to m occurrences of the previous pattern. For example, a{2,4} matches two to four occurrences of the letter "a".

```
regex = r'\b\d{3}\.\d{3}\.\d{4}\b'
```

<h4>Methods</h4>

* `re.compile(pattern, flags=0)`:

> Compiles a regular expression into a regular expression pattern object for later use.
>  <br>
> `pattern:` the regular expression to be compiled.
>  <br>
> `flags (optional):` modifiers that change the behavior of the regular expression.

```
default_phonenumber = re.compile(regex)
```

* `re.match(pattern, string, flags=0):`

> Checks if the regular expression matches the beginning of the string.
> <br>
> Returns a match object if the regular expression matches; otherwise, returns _None_.

* `re.search(pattern, string, flags=0):`

> Searches for a match anywhere in the string.
> <br>
> Returns a match object if the regular expression matches; otherwise, returns _None_.

```
case1 = "My number is 123.456.7890"
match1 = default_phonenumber.search(case1)
```

* `re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0):`

> Finds all occurrences of the regular expression in the string.
> <br>
> Returns a list of all matches found.

```
default = re.compile(r'\Bword\B')
text = "sword, word, wordpress, wordy"
result = default.findall(text)
print(result) # Output: ['word', 'word']
```

* `re.finditer(pattern, string, flags=0):`

> Finds all occurrences of the regular expression in the string.
> <br>
> Returns an iterator that produces match objects for each match found.

```
text = "banana"
default = re.compile(r'ana')

for match in pattern.finditer(text):
    start = match.start() # match start index
    end = match.end() # match end index
    print(f"Found '{match.group()}' between indexes {start} and {end}.") 
```

* `re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0):`

> Replaces all occurrences of the regular expression in the string with new text.
>  <br>
> Returns a new string with all replacements made.
>  <br>
> `count:` limits the maximum number of replacements, if greater than 0, replaces _n_ matches from left to right, if less than 0, will replace except the last _n_ matches;
> <br>
> `repl:` value that will replace in the `string`;

* `re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)`:

> Splits the string into substrings using the regular expression as delimiter.
> <br>
> Returns a list of the resulting substrings.
> <br>
> `maxsplit:` limits the maximum number of divisions to _n_ times;

* `match.group(n=0):`

> Method of matching objects returned by search methods (`findall()`, `finditer()`, `match()`, `search()`).
> <br>
> It is used to get the matching text found in the original string.
> If you provide an integer argument n, where n is the capture group number, it returns the text corresponding to the specified capture group.
> If there are no capturing groups in the regular expression, the default argument is 0, matching the entire match.

```
text = "Date of birth: 03/12/1990"
default = re.compile(r'Date of birth: (\d{2})/(\d{2})/(\d{4})')

match = pattern.search(text)
if match:
    print("Day:", match.group(2))
    print("Month:", match.group(1))
    print("Year:", match.group(3))
    print("Match:", match.group())
```

<h5>flags</h5>

* `re.IGNORECASE` or `re.I`:

> Matches patterns in a case-insensitive manner.

* `re.MULTILINE` or `re.M`:

> Allows the ^ and $ metacharacters to match the start and end of each line (in addition to the start and end of the string).

* `re.DOTALL` or `re.S`:
  
> Makes the dot (.) metacharacter match any character, including line breaks (\n).

* `re.VERBOSE` or `re.X`:

> Allows you to write more readable regular expressions by ignoring whitespace and comments within the regular expression.

```
# Regular expression with re.VERBOSE
default_with_verbose = re.compile(r'''
    \b # Start of word
    (?: # Non-capturing group for the first set of digits
        \d{3}\. # Three digits followed by a period
    )?          # The first set is optional
    \d{3} # Three digits
    \.          # A dot
    \d{3} # Three digits
    - # A hyphen
    \d{2} # Two digits
    \b # End of word
''', re.VERBOSE)

# Testing regular expressions
cpf = "My CPF is 123.456.789-01"

result_with_verbose = default_with_verbose.search(cpf)
```

* `re.ASCII` or `re.A`:

> Ensures that only ASCII characters are considered by the regular expression.

* `|:`

> Bitwise operator to add multiple flags in the regex;

```
flags=re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL
```

<h3>tkinter (GUI)</h3>

> import __tkinter__ as __tk__

‚Üí It is a built-in module that allows the creation of graphical interfaces in a simple way.

* root_window = `tk.Tk()`

<h4>The main window</h4>

> `tk.Tk():` creates the main application window, being essential because it is the ___starting point for any graphical interface___.

* The `Tk` _class instance_ is the root of windows, widgets and components.

* The window is like a _container_ of widgets.

<h4>Main methods</h5>

* root_window`.mainloop():` starts the application's ___event loop___.
* root_window`.destroy():` destroys the window.
* root_window`.title(str):` sets the window title.
* root_window`.geometry(<width>x<height>+or-<posx>+or-<posy>):` determines the size to be displayed and the position on the screen.
* root_window`.protocol(protocol, command):` used to associate a function (or method) with a specific window event (_protocol example_: try `'WM_DELETE_WINDOW'` when the user tries to close the window by clicking the close button (X)).
* root_window`.inconbitmap('image.ico'):` change the window icon.
* root_window`.withdraw():` hide the window.
* root_window`.deiconify():` show hidden window.
* root_window`.minsize(with, height):` sets the minimum window size.
* root_window`.maxsize(with, height):` sets the maximum window size.
* root_window`.winfo_screenwidth():` captures the user's screen width.
* root_window`.winfo_screenheight():` captures the user's screen height.
* root_window`.winfo_children():` gets all child _widgets_ of the window.

<h4>Event loop</h4>

‚Üí It is a _continuous cycle_ that waits for and dispatches _events_ or messages in a program.

* Detects user actions;
* Calls the callback functions associated with these _events_;
* Manages GUI update;
* üîÑ It runs continuously throughout the life of the application, waiting for events and responding to them.

<h5>Methods for handling events</h5>

* root_window`.quit():` close the loop;
* root_window`.update():` processes all queued events and updates the GUI;
* root_window`.update_idletasks():` processes tasks that need to be executed when the program is idle;
* root_window`.after(ms, callback, *args):` schedules a function to be called after certain milliseconds;
* root_window`.bind(event, callback, add=None):` associates a function with an event that can occur in a widget or in user interaction;
* root_window`.unbind(event, id=None):` removes the association of an event with a function;
* root_window`.event_generate(event, **kwargs):` generates an event manually, which can be useful for simulating user events.

<h4>Control variables</h4>

‚Üí They are special objects that serve as intermediaries between _widgets_ and the values ‚Äã‚Äãthey display or store.
* `tk.StringVar()`
* `tk.IntVar()`
* `tk.DoubleVar()`
* `tk.BooleanVar()`
> Use variable`.get()` to capture the object's value and variable`.set(value)` to modify its value.

<h4>Widgets</h4>

‚Üí _Widgets_ are elements of a graphical user interface (GUI) that allow users to interact with the program, they can be _buttons_, _text boxes_, _labels_, _menus_, and other controls that receive and display information or provide a specific way for the user to interact with the operating system or an application.

* `tk.Label(window, text or image, **kwargs)`
> `**kwargs:` it is possible to customize the label text, using __anchor__ for the text position (N, E, S, W, NE, SE, SW, NW or CENTER), __font__ and __size__ (it is possible to pass a tuple with the name of the font and the size, such as font=("Arial", 12)), __fg__ for font color ("white", "black", "blue"...) and __bg__ for background color...
* `tk.Button(window, text, command)`
> `command` is the _reference_ of the function or method to be used on the button; the function/method reference does not involve its call, so it ___does not need the parentheses ()___.
* `tk.Entry(window)`
* `tk.Checkbutton(window, text, var)`
> `var` is the variable associated with the checkbox, usually a `tk.BooleanVar()`
* `tk.Radiobutton(window, text, var, value)`
> `value` is the value that the associated variable will receive when this radiobutton is selected.
* `tk.Listbox(winsow, selectmode)`
> `selectmode` is the selection mode (SINGLE, BROWSE, MULTIPLE, EXTENDED).
> <br>
> selection_list = tk.Listbox(window, SINGLE), use selection_list`.insert(position, item)` to insert items into the Listbox.
* `tk.Canvas(window, width, height)`
> `canvas.create_*(x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., *kwargs)` creates geometric figures, such as lines, circles, squares, rectangles, among others.
* `tk.Frame(window, **kwargs)`
> `what is it for:` serves as a container to organize other widgets visually.
> <br>
> `**kwargs:` _borderwidth_: specifies the width of the frame border (default is zero); _height_ and _width_: defines the height and the width of the frame; _padding_: creates spacing within the frame and around the contained widgets; _cursor_: changes the appearance of the cursor when it is over the frame; _style_: specifies a custom style for the widget...

<h5>Widget methods</h5>

* widget`.pack(**kwargs):` to organize and position widgets within a _container_, such as a window or _frame_.
> The method automatically calculates the position and size of the widget.
> <br>
> `**kwargs:` __side__ to specify which side the widget should be wrapped on, __fill__ to define how it should fill the available space, __expand__ to determine whether it should expand to fill the entire space, __padx__ and __pady__, to control the _horizontal_ and _vertical_ padding around of the widget.
> <br>
> widget`.pack_forget():` used to temporarily hide a widget when using pack.
* widget`.grid(**kwargs):` geometry manager that organizes widgets into a grid (or table) of rows and columns.
> `**kwargs:` __row__, __column__, __rowspan__ and __columnspan__(defines how many rows and columns the widget will cover), __sticky__(defines where the widget should "stick" within the grid cell, it can be a combination of directions, N, S, E, W), __padx__ and __pady__, __ipadx__ and __ipady__ (internal horizontal and vertical padding).
> <br>
> widget`.grid_remove():` used to temporarily hide a widget when using grid.
* widget`.place(x, y, width, heigth, **kwargs):` allows you to explicitly set the position and size of a widget relative to the window or another widget.
> This method gives you a little more control over the interface design.
> <br>
> `**kwargs:` _relx_ and _rely_: specify the relative coordinates of the widget's top-left corner relative to the size of the parent widget; _aanchor_: sets the widget's anchor point (‚ÄúN‚Äù, ‚ÄúNE‚Äù, ‚ÄúE‚Äù, ‚ÄúSE‚Äù, ‚ÄúS‚Äù, ‚ÄúSW‚Äù, ‚ÄúW‚Äù or ‚ÄúNW‚Äù); _bodermode_: defines whether other options refer to the inside or outside of the widget ( ‚ÄúINSIDE‚Äù (default) or ‚ÄúOUTSIDE‚Äù; _in__: allows you to place a widget inside another...
> <br>
> widget`.place_forget():` used to temporarily hide a widget when using place.

<h4>Secondary window</h4>

‚Üí üëë `Heritage:` the Toplevel class inherits the methods and attributes of the Tk class, as a consequence, it depends on a main window and the ___event loop___ is called only on the Tk instance.

* `tk.Toplevel(root_window):` creates a new window that is a child of the main window, that is, it is part of the same application.
* window`.wait_window(window):` causes program execution to wait until the specified window is destroyed.

<h4>Message boxes and dialogs</h4>

> from `tkinter` import `simpledialog`

‚Üí `simpledialog:` provides methods for creating simple dialog boxes.

* `simpledialog.askstring(title, question, **kwargs)`
* `simpledialog.askinteger(title, question, **kwargs)`
* `simpledialog.askfloat(title, question, **kwargs)`
> `**kwargs:` title, prompt, initialValue, minvalue and maxvalue.

> from `tkinter` import `messagebox`

‚Üí  `messagebox:` provides methods for displaying predefined message boxes, such as warning, error, information, and question messages.

* `messagebox.showinfo(title, message, **kwargs)`
* `messagebox.showwarning(title, message, **kwargs)`
* `messagebox.showerror(title, message, **kwargs)`
* `messagebox.askquestion(title, message, **kwargs)`
> `askquestion` returns the strings 'yes' or 'no' depending on the option chosen by the user.
> <br>
> `**kwargs:` title, message, icon and type.

<h3>time</h3>

> import __time__

‚Üí Offers a variety of powerful features for working with dates and times.

* __time__`.time():` returns the number of seconds since the reference date (milestone zero or EPOCH).
> It is useful for measuring the execution time of a piece of code.

```
start = time.time()
# code
end = time.time()
duration = end - start
```

* __time__`.sleep(seconds):` pauses program execution for a specified number of seconds.
> Useful for creating delays or gaps between operations.

```
time.sleep(2) # pause the program for 2 seconds
```

* __time__`.localtime():` returns a local date and time object.
> Contains information such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.

* __time__`.strftime(format, object_date_hour):` converts a datetime object to a formatted string.
> The format can include codes to represent different parts of the date and time (for example: _%Y_ for the full year, _%m_ for month in two-digit format, _%d_ for the day of the month, _%A_ for the full name of the day of the week, _%B_ for the full name of the month...).

* __time`.gmtime():` returns a date and time object in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) format.
> Useful for dealing with time zones and conversions between different time zones.

<h2>Creating Functions</h2>

Using the word `def` you can define a function.

> def funtion(): # file function.py
> <br>
>----# function code

‚Üí This way it is possible to call custom functions in other files, using the module name and calling its function:

```
import functionp
functionp.function()
```

‚Üí Functions can have parameters and returns:

```
def sum(a,b):
     return a + b
s = sum(3,4)
```

‚Üí It is possible to import only specific functions `from` the module, use aliases `as` to re-present the module or even load all functions, methods and classes from the module using `*`:

```
from module_name import function_name1, function_name2
import module_name as my_module
from module_name import *
```

`__name__:` an execution variable that indicates the context in which a module or script is being executed.

> Therefore, it can be `__main__` when executed `directly` or the `module name` if `imported`:

```
if(__name__ == "__main__")
    function()
```

<h3>Parameters</h3>

* In _dynamic typing_, the passing of object parameters is ***by reference*** (in the case of mutable objects), pointing to the `array` type variable, for example.

* Values ‚Äã‚Äãof _primitive types_ are immutable, so passing is ***by value***, as in the case of `str` and `int`.

<h3>Variables</h3>

<h4>Local Variables:</h4>

* Defined within a method or function;

* The scope is limited to that function or method;

* It is _created when the function is called_ and _destroyed when completed_;

def example():
    var_local = "local"

<h4>Global Variables</h4>

* Defined outside the function;

* It is accessible anywhere in the code;

```
var_global = "global"
def example():
    pass
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If you need to modify a global variable within a function, you will need to declare it as global within the function;

<h3>Lambda</h3>

‚Üí `lambda` functions are small functions that can have any number of arguments, but only one expression. 

‚Üí They are useful when you need a temporary function for a simple operation.

> __lambda__ _args_: _expression_ # assignature

```
square = lambda x:x**2
result = square(5) #25
```

<h3>üîÅ Callback function</h3>

‚Üí When a function is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked within that function.

> _Example_: You can use a callback function to perform an action when an ___event___(mouse clicks and movements, key presses, screen loadings...) occurs or when an ___asynchronous operation___(is an operation that allows the program to continue performing other tasks) completes.

```
# Example
def callback(value):
    print(value)
def multitwo(value, callback):
    result = value * 2
    callback(result)
multitwo(5, callback) # using function with callback
```

<h2>Sequence Types</h2>

The main sequence types are, in addition to strings, lists (vectors and matrices), tuples, dictionaries, ordered and unordered collections.

<h3>str</h3>

A string is considered one of the main sequence types.

‚Üí A string is a `sequence of characters` and can be manipulated (***in Python***) like a sequence, meaning you can access individual characters by index, iterate over the characters, slice the string, and perform various sequence-specific operations.

* `.format():` used to perform `string interpolation`, that is, it allows you to insert values ‚Äã‚Äãinto a formatted string, replacing placeholders `{}`.

```
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("My name is {} and I am {}".format(name,age))
```

* `.find():` used to find the position of a substring occurrence.

```
word = "banana"
word.find("b") # returns the position 0
```

* `.upper():` method of creating a substring with all characters capitalized.

```
word = "banana"
word.upper() # returns BANANA
```

* `.lower():` convert to lowercase.

```
word = "BANANA"
word.lower() # returns banana
```

* `.strip():` removes empty spaces.

```
words = "for get"
words.strip() # returns 'forget'
```

* `.split():` splits a string into list using ___sep___ as delimiter, if it is not used, whitespace will be used as ___sep___.

```
words = "for get"
words.split() # returns '["for", "get"]'
```

* `.join():` Concatenates a sequence of strings based on the passed delimiter.

```
delimiter = ""
words = ["for", "get"]
delimiter.join(words) # returns "forget"
```

* `.isdigit()`, `.isalpha()`, `.isalnum():` checks whether the string consists of only digits, letters, or letters and numbers, respectively.

```
s = "12345"
print(s.isdigit())  # Output: True

s = "hello"
print(s.isalpha())  # Output: True

s = "hello123"
print(s.isalnum())  # Output: True
```

<summary>strings interpolation</summary>

* In the format function you can pass parameter index {`0`}, {`1`}
> * It is possible to format floats {`:f`} to define the type, {`:.2f`} 2 places after the comma, {`:.7.2f`} width of 7 characters and 2 of which will be after the decimal point., {`:02d`} an integer in a string with a total width of 2 characters, and padding with leading zeros if necessary (type `d` = integers).

* `f-strings:` can tell Python that values ‚Äã‚Äãwill be inserted directly into a string.

```
name = 'Mathew'
print(f'My name is {name}')
number = 1.2345
print(f'Number with two digits before and after the comma: {number:2.2f}')
# It is also possible to pass functions and methods
```

</details>

> The `str` type is ***immutable***, so string methods will always create replicas, that is, substrings.

<h3>lists</h3>

To create a list we use `[]`:

```
var = []
```

‚Üí It is  possible to access its methods such as `.append()` to add an element at the end, `.extend()` to add a iterable, `.index(element)` to return the index of an element in the list , `.remove(element)` to remove an element from the list, `.insert(index, element)` to add the element at a specific position defined by the index, `.count()` to count the quantity of elements in the list, `.sort()` to sort the list, `.pop(index)` to remove the last element of the list or an element in the index position, `.reverse()` to make the list backwardsor or `.clear()` to clear the list;

> The `in` operator returns _True_ or _False_ if the element is inside the list;

```
list = ['element', 'object']
'element' in list # returns True
 ```
<h4>List functions</h4>

> The `reversed()` function returns an iterator that the elements of the original sequence are in reverse order.

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_numbers = list(reversed(numbers))
print(reversed_numbers) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

> The `sorted()` function returns an ordered iterable of list elements.

```
list = [3, 1, 2]
sorted = sorted(list) # [1, 2, 3]
```

> The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the list.

```
list = [1, 2, 3]
len = len(list) # 3
```

> The `min()` and `max()` functions returns the smallest and largest list elements, respectively.

```
list = [1,2,3]
min = min(list) # 1
max = max(list) # 3
```

> The `sum()` function returns the sum of all numbers in the list (__only works with lists of numbers__).

```
list = [1,2,3]
sum = sum(list) # 6
```

> The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to an iterable and returns an enumerator object that can be used to iterate over the iterable's index and value pairs.

```
list = [1,2,3]
for index, element in enumerate(list):
    print(f'{index}: {element}') # Output: the index of the element and the element separated by ':' 
```

<h4>List comprehension</h4>

‚Üí It's a concise and elegant way to create lists using a for loop to generate the list's elements.

> list = [_expression_ __for__ _item_ __in__ _sequence_]

```
text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
ascii = [ord(char) for char in text]
```

<summary>Slicing</summary>

Technique for accessing subsequences of sequences, such as arrays.

> ___sequence___[_start_:_stop_:_step_] is the signature

* _start_: subsequence starting index (inclusive);
* _stop_: subsequence end index (unique);
* _step_: interval between indexes;

```
s = "Hello, World!"
sub = s[0:5] # Hello
sub = s[:5] # Hello
sub = s[7:] # World!
sub = s[::2] # Hlo ol!
sub = s[::-1] # reverses the string(array)
```

<h3>tuples</h3>

To create a tuple we use `()`:

```
var = ()
```

> The `list()` is _mutable_, while the `tuple()` is _immutable_.

‚ö†Ô∏è Methods that alter lists ***do not*** work on tuples!

‚û°Ô∏è <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuples" target="_blank">More about tuples methods...</a>

<h3>lists x tuples</h3>

‚Üí It is possible to implement lists within tuples and vice versa;

```
foods = ['rice', 'bean']
drinks = ['water', 'juice']
stock = (foods, drinks)
```

‚Üí To access values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom lists or tuples with implementation, use `[][]`;

```
foods = ['rice', 'bean']
drinks = ['water', 'juice']
stock = (foods, drinks)

# Acessing the list of foods
list_foods = stock[0]
print(list_foods)  # Output: ['rice', 'bean']

# Acessing the list of drinks
list_drinks = stock[1]
print(list_drinks)  # Output: ['water', 'juice']

# Acessing the first item of the food list
first_food = stock[0][0]
print(first_food)  # Output: 'rice'
```

‚Üí Using the `list()` and `tuple()` functions it is possible to convert arrays;

> Remember that when you try to convert a tuple to a list, you are creating a new list and not changing the original tuple, since _tuples are immutable_.

<h3>set</h3>

`set()` is used to create a collection (***not a sequence***) with unique elements using `{}`:

```
var = {}
```

‚Üí To add values ‚Äã‚Äãto _set_ you must use `.add()`, to add arrays use `.update(array)`, to remove an item use `.remove(element)` if you want to generate an error if the element does not exist, to remove an item use `.discard(element)` if you don't want to generate errors if the element does not exist, to clear the set use `.clear()`;

‚Üí _set_ has no indexes as it is _not a sequence_.

<h4>set operations</h4>

* `Union:` setA.___union___(setB);
* `Intersection:` setA.___intersection___(setB);
* `Difference:` setA.___difference___(setB);
* `Symetric difference:` setA.___symetric_difference___(setB);
* `If is a subset:` supersetA.___issubset___(subssetB);
* `If is a super set:` subsetB.___issuperset___(supersetA);

<h3>dict</h3>

The `dict()` creates a collection (***not a sequence***) that associates key with value:

```
var = {'value':1}
```

‚Üí You can associate a key to create lists:

```
# Creating a empty dict
my_dict = {}

# Adding keys and associating lists to them
my_dict['fruits'] = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
my_dict['animals'] = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']

# Acessing the values associated to the keys
print(my_dict['fruits'])  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
print(my_dict['animals'])  # Output: ['cachorro', 'cat', 'bird']

```

‚Üí To replace a value or update the dict:

```
my_dict['fruits'][3] = "lemon" # ['apple', 'banana', 'lemon']
my_dict.update('vegetables': ['lettuce', 'potato', 'carrot'])
```

‚Üí To delete keys:

```
del my_dict['animals'] # delete key
my_dict.pop() # delete and return its value
my_dict.popitem() # delete the last key
```

‚Üí To fetch keys:

```
my_dict.items() # return all keys
my_dict.get('animals', "animals not found") # Return: animals not found
my_dict.get('vegetables') # Retturn: ['lettuce', 'potato', 'carrot']
```

‚Üí Iterating a dict:

```
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f'{key}: ')
    for item in value:
        print(f'{item}')
```

<details>

<summary>OrderedDict</summary>

* Is a subclass of the dict (dictionary) type in Python that maintains the insertion order of items:

```
from collections import OrderedDict

# Creating a OrderedDict
ordered_dict = OrderedDict()

# Adding items
ordered_dict['one'] = 1
ordered_dict['two'] = 2
ordered_dict['three'] = 3

# Iterating over the OrderedDict
for key, value in ordered_dict.items():
    print(key, value)
```

‚Üí `OrderedDict():` class method.

‚Üí `collections:` library.

<h3>map</h3>

`map()` is a `built-in function` that takes a function and one or more iterables (like lists, tuples, etc.) as arguments. 

‚Üí It applies the function to each element of the iterables and returns an iterator that produces the results.

> __map__(_function_, _iterable1_, _iterable2_, ...) # assignature

- _function_: the function to be applied to each element of the iterables.
_iterable1_, _iterable1_, ...: one or more iterables (lists, tuples, etc.) whose elements will be passed to the function.

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = map(lambda x:x**2, numbers)
print(squares) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
surnames = ['Smith', 'Jones', 'Brown']
# Concatenate the full names
full_names = map(lambda name, surname: name + ' ' + surname, names, surnames)
print(list(full_names)) # Output: ['Alice Smith', 'Bob Jones', 'Charlie Brown']
```

<h4>‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful with maps!</h4>

* `map()` returns an iterator, not a list. You can convert this iterator to a list using `list()`, as shown in the examples above;
* The _function passed_ to `map()` can be any function (defined by `def` or `lambda` function) that accepts the correct number of arguments.
* If the _iterables_ passed to `map()` are of different _lengths_, `map()` will stop when the shortest iterable is exhausted.

<h3>Simulating matrices</h3>

Python can simulate a `matrix` using `linked lists`. 

‚Üí Although Python does not have a built-in matrix data type, you can create a two-dimensional (or multidimensional).

‚Üí Each element of the main list is a list (or other data structure, such as another list) representing a row of the headquarters.

```
array = [[0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0]]
```

‚Üí This makes it possible to simulate some actions that occur in the matrices:

```
array[0][0] = 1 # updated the value of the initial row and column
array[0].append([0,0,0]) # adding another row with 3 zeros in the matrix
for row in array: # adding the value 1 to each row of the array
    row.append(1)
for i, row in enumerate(array): 
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
        print(value) # printing the array values
```

<h2>Files</h2>

‚Üí To open a file:

```
file = open("file_name.txt", "w")
```

> `file_name` is the name of the file;
> `w:` to write;
> `r:` to read;
> `rb:` to read binary;
> `a:` to append;

‚Üí To write to a file:

```
file.write("word")
```

‚Üí To close a file:

```
file.close()
```

‚Üí To read a file:

```
file.read() #.readLine reads a line
```

* The read pointer goes to the end of the file, so you have to open it again.

> `with:` guarantees the closure of the file even with an error.

```
content = ""
with open("file_name.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```
